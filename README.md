# This is the refactor test for Christian Arevalo

This repository is intended to cover the requirements contained in the Laravel Refactor file for Swim Communications - DA. The purpose of this code should be exclusively for assesment only and should not be used for commercial purposes.

# Analisys of requirements

The first step on the test I made was read and analize the conditions stated in the document Laravel Refactor and then I moved to do the same in the given code.

# Design of DB and object conditions

After reviewing the code the next big step I took was design a data structure from reverse engineering the existing code.

This is the proposed diagram that the refactored code will follow from now on:
